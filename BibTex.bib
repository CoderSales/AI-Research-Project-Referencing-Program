abstract = {DevOps have received marginal attention inside the higher education level curricula despite of its boom in the industrial sector.
This paper presents the design of an academic master-level course aimed at DevOps. The proposed design is based on earlier experiences in teaching DevOps-related topics. The specification of the course design is provided using the SWEBOK Guide and Bloom’s taxonomy to enhance the quality of the course design specification, and ease its assessment once delivered.},
